# Experiment 3: DML Commands

## AIM
To study and implement DML (Data Manipulation Language) commands.

## THEORY

### 1. INSERT INTO
Used to add records into a relation.
These are three type of INSERT INTO queries which are as
A)Inserting a single record
**Syntax (Single Row):**
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (field_1, field_2, ...) VALUES (value_1, value_2, ...);
```
**Syntax (Multiple Rows):**
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (field_1, field_2, ...) VALUES
(value_1, value_2, ...),
(value_3, value_4, ...);
```
**Syntax (Insert from another table):**
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name SELECT * FROM other_table WHERE condition;
```
### 2. UPDATE
Used to modify records in a relation.
Syntax:
```sql
UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2 WHERE condition;
```
### 3. DELETE
Used to delete records from a relation.
**Syntax (All rows):**
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
```
**Syntax (Specific condition):**
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
### 4. SELECT
Used to retrieve records from a table.
**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
**Question 1**

Increase quantity of all products by 10% to adjust for surplus stock counted:

&emsp;**product_id**  
&emsp;**product_name**  
&emsp;**category**  
&emsp;**cost_price**  
&emsp;**sell_price**  
&emsp;**reorder_lvl**  
&emsp;**quantity**  
&emsp;**supplier_id**

```sql
update products set quantity = quantity * 1.10;
```

**Output:**

**Question 2**

Certainly! Here's the formatted version with `&emsp;` and bold where necessary:

**Write a SQL query to reduce the reorder level by 30% where cost price is more than 50 and quantity in stock is less than 100 in the products table.**

&emsp;**Products Table** 
&emsp;**product_id**     INT PRIMARY KEY  
&emsp;**product_name**   VARCHAR(10)  
&emsp;**category**       VARCHAR(50)  
&emsp;**cost_price**     DECIMAL(10)  
&emsp;**sell_price**     DECIMAL(10)  
&emsp;**reorder_lvl**    INT  
&emsp;**quantity**       INT  
&emsp;**supplier_id**    INT  

```sql
update products set reorder_lvl = reorder_lvl * 0.70 where cost_price > 50 and quantity < 100;
```

**Output:**

**Question 3**

**Write a SQL statement to change the first_name column of the employees table with 'John' for those employees whose department_id is 80 and gets a commission_pct below 0.35.**

&emsp;**Employees table**

&emsp;employee_id  
&emsp;first_name  
&emsp;last_name  
&emsp;email  
&emsp;phone_number  
&emsp;hire_date  
&emsp;job_id  
&emsp;salary  
&emsp;commission_pct  
&emsp;manager_id  
&emsp;department_id  

```sql
update employees set first_name = 'John' where department_id = 80 and commission_pct < 0.35;
```

**Output:**

&emsp;**Customer table**  

&emsp;customer_id

&emsp;city  
&emsp;grade  
&emsp;salesman_id

## RESULT
Thus, the SQL queries to implement DML commands have been executed successfully.
